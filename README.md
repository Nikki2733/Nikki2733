I'm here to help with code guidance. To download PhoneInfoga, you'll typically clone its repository from GitHub. Here's a common method using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skelsec/PhoneInfoga.git
```

After cloning, navigate into the directory:

```bash
cd PhoneInfoga
```

And follow the installation instructions in the repository's README to set it up, which may include installing dependencies or setting up a virtual environment.

If you need help with scripting or integrating PhoneInfoga into your project, I can assist with that.- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nikki2733
